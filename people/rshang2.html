       I am Ruo-Yu Shang, a PhD student in physics at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. When I was 5-year old, my grandma gave me a spyglass to let me watching a pair of pica pica building their nest in our front yard. The nest was built on a tree. I watched the pair everyday and recorded their behaviors by drawing the birds in a drawing book of mine. Everyday in the twilight, when my grandma came home after she finished the grocery shopping of the day, I told her what the birds did on that day, how many eggs in the nest, what food they brought home for the baby birds, and I showed her my drawings. She always gave me a bottle of chocolate mile as a reward. Since then, I started my journey to become a scientist.
