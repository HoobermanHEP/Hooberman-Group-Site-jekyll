		 I am Cunwei Fan, a graduate student in physics department.  I have been interested in applying data science techniques and numerical methods to the study of fundamental laws of physics since my undergraduate years when I was doing numerical relativity. Thus I joined Ben's group for my graduate study. My current role in the group is exploring supersymmetry from experimental data by means of deep learning. Hopefully, in the near future, I will contribute my own efforts together with the group's to the new milestone of physics.
