        I wanna be the very best
        Like no one ever was
        To find them is my real test
        To learn them is my cause

        I will travel across the land
        Searching far and wide
        Teach people to understand
        The physics that's inside

        [Chorus]
        Particles! Gotta find 'em all! The LHC!
        I know it's my destiny,
        Particles! Oh you're hard to know
        In a world we must define
        Particles! A search so true
        Our science will pull us through,

        You teach me and I'll teach you,
        Particles! Gotta find'em all

        [Chorus]

        Every challenge along the way
        With science I will pace.
        I will ponder every day
        To find the special case.
        Come with me,
        Near speeds of light,
        There's no better team.
        Arm in arm we'll get it right!
        It's always been our dream!
