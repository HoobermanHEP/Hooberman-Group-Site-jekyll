        <i>
        I wanna be the very best</br>
        Like no one ever was</br>
        To find them is my real test</br>
        To learn them is my cause</br>
        </br>
        I will travel across the land</br>
        Searching far and wide</br>
        Teach people to understand</br>
        The physics that's inside</br>
        </br>
        [Chorus]</br>
        Particles! Gotta find 'em all! The LHC!</br>
        I know it's my destiny,</br>
        Particles! Oh you're hard to know</br>
        In a world we must define</br>
        Particles! A search so true</br>
        Our science will pull us through,</br>
        </br>
        You teach me and I'll teach you,</br>
        Particles! Gotta find'em all</br>
        </br>
        [Chorus]</br>
        </br>
        Every challenge along the way</br>
        With science I will pace.</br>
        I will ponder every day</br>
        To find the special case.</br>
        Come with me,</br>
        Near speeds of light,</br>
        There's no better team.</br>
        Arm in arm we'll get it right!</br>
        It's always been our dream!</br>
