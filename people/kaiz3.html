		Hi, my name is Kai Zheng. I am currently a second year physics PhD student. My research focus on machine learning application and data analysis in particle physics. I have been interested in fundamental physics, both theoretical and experimental, ever since I was an undergraduate student in Zhejiang University. I am an international student from Beijing, China. Feel free to contact me if you have any question.
