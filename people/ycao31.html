        Hi guys! This is Yumeng Cao, an international student from mainland China. Among all the physics research directions, I prefer experimental high energy physics (HEX) the most. I joined Prof. Hooberman's group in the first half of my sophomore year as an undergraduate student. During these two years, I've learned quite a lot, not only the physics knowledge and the research skills, but also the ways to cooperate with other colleagues. It's so lucky to see that my research interests lie very close to Prof. Hooberman's. As a result, now I've "rejoined" the group as a PhD student and I'm very excited to continue the work.
