		The Standard Model (SM) of Physics describes all the constituents of our universe in terms of 17 elementary particles: 12 matter particles, 4 force carriers, and the Higgs Boson. The recent discovery of the latter was the last experimental verification of the SM. However, it is well established that the SM is incomplete, as it does not account for dark matter (25% of our universe). My research efforts focus on searching the experimental signatures of Supersymmetry (a very promising alternative to the SM) processes at the Large Hadron Collider, and search for Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay with the EXO experiment.
