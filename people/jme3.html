		I am a current Ph.D. candidate in the University of Illinois’ Physics Department. Since joining the department, I have worked as a teaching assistant for one semester, and as a research assistant every semester under Prof. Ben Hooberman’s group as well as Prof. Liang Yang’s. My research focus is on searches for beyond standard model (BSM) physics; we aim to do this in hunts for supersymmetric (SUSY) particles in the proton-proton collisions at the LHC’s ATLAS detector (Hooberman group), and in searches for neutrinoless double beta decay in the EXO experiment (Yang group). At UIUC, I have thus far worked in developing methods for background modeling in SUSY searches for the Hooberman group; and also in R&D of large area silicon photomultipliers, the next-generation light detectors to be used in the EXO experiment, for the Yang group. Post-graduation, I would like to keep contributing to the advancement of science in one way or another.
