      <div class="panel-body">
		I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in physics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My current research efforts focus on experimental particle physics, in particular, searches for physics beyond the Standard Model with EXO (Yang group) and ATLAS (Hooberman group). I have also worked at the SBN program at Fermilab and the LUX dark matter experiment.</br></br>

In many ways, my journey towards becoming a scientist was similar to that of becoming a pro triathlete. When I first set out on that path, it also seemed like an impossible task, given my poor academic performance over my high school years, which led me to believe that I was simply not smart enough. Yet, much like in triathlon, I was determined to find out how much better I could become through sheer dedication. Later I found out that there has been a lot of research on this topic: the so-called growth mindset. In short, intelligence is not a fixed trait of each individual, but rather it is possible to work and develop it. As a prime example, I went from being a struggling high-school student, to graduating college with honors and being offered a fellowship to attend one of the best physics programs in the world.</br></br>

I aim to discuss these things not with a self-aggrandizing intent, but rather to demonstrate that it is possible to achieve seemingly far-fetched goals with enough perseverance and dedication. I look forward to the challenges that lie ahead, and strive to encourage everyone to challenge themselves -the results could be surprising!</br></br>
